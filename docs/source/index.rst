Welcome to ygit's documentation!
===================================

**ygit** is a tiny (yocto) git client for MicroPython microcontrollers / other memory-constrained environments (<100k) 
like the $6 ESP32. It speaks to git HTTP/HTTPS servers using the ubiquitous smart client protocol. I use it to remotely
deploy/update code.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
